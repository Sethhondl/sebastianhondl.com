# About This Blog

Hi, I'm **Sebastian Hondl**, a software developer documenting my journey of building software with AI assistance.

## The Concept

Every day, I use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) as my AI pair programmer. This blog is an automated system that:

1. **Captures** my Claude Code sessions throughout the day
2. **Analyzes** what I worked on across different projects
3. **Generates** a daily blog post summarizing the work
4. **Publishes** it here automatically

The posts you read are generated by Claude itself, based on our actual coding conversations. It's AI writing about AI-assisted development - meta, I know!

## Why?

I started this project for a few reasons:

- **Learning in public**: Sharing my journey helps others and keeps me accountable
- **Documenting progress**: It's easy to forget what you've learned; this creates a record
- **Exploring automation**: The blog system itself is a fun project in automation
- **Authentic AI content**: Each post reflects real work, not hypothetical scenarios

## The Tech

This blog is built with:

- **Jekyll** for static site generation
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Claude Code** for content generation
- **Python** for automation scripts
- **macOS launchd** for scheduling

The entire system runs automatically - I just code, and the blog updates itself.

## Projects I Work On

I work on a variety of projects, from web applications to hardware integrations. Some recurring themes:

- Computer vision and robotics
- Developer tools and automation
- Web applications and APIs
- AI/ML integrations
