I don't see a draft matching the gripper/robot calibration topic you described. There's no post about force calibration debugging or gripper sensors in the drafts directory. 

It sounds like the draft hasn't been written to disk yet. Could you either:

1. **Paste the draft content** here so I can polish it, or
2. **Point me to where the draft lives** (perhaps it was generated in a previous step and saved elsewhere)?

Without the actual text, I can't do a meaningful polish pass - I'd just be writing a new post from your outline rather than refining existing prose.
