Naming things might be the most human task in all of engineering. We agonize over variable names, debate function signatures, and treat project titles like they'll be carved in stone. Today I spent hours with Claude Code not writing a single line of production code—just searching for the perfect name for an app. It reminded me that AI collaboration extends far beyond syntax and algorithms into the messy, iterative territory of pure creativity.

## The Problem with Working Titles

I've been building an AI assistant that helps engineers run parametric studies and analyze simulation results—automated sweeps of design variables, real-time convergence monitoring, intelligent post-processing of CFD and FEA output. My working title referenced specific simulation tools, but I needed something vendor-neutral. A name that could stand alone whether users were running ANSYS, COMSOL, or custom solvers.

Simple enough, right? Find something memorable, professional, and evocative of the technical domain. One or two syllables. Easy.

Three days later, I was still searching.

## Starting Broad, Then Narrowing

My first prompt asked Claude to brainstorm directions. What came back was organized exactly how my brain needed it: concepts grouped by metaphor type—AI companion, engineering terms, abstract and catchy—with reasoning for each suggestion. I wasn't starting from zero anymore. I had handholds.

"Nexus" and "Forge" caught my attention from the initial batch. I asked Claude to explore combinations. But something felt off about the suggestions that came back. The app's mathematical core wasn't coming through.

So I pivoted: "Let's find something that has a little bit more math in it."

Claude immediately produced options organized across linear algebra, calculus, and Greek letters. No research delay. No "let me think about it." Just instant, structured exploration.

"Gradiant" jumped out—and yes, the spelling is intentional. A portmanteau of "gradient" and "radiant," suggesting both the mathematical concept central to optimization and the illumination of clarity. Clever without being forced.

But it needed something else. I wanted to capture the descent in gradient descent, the optimization algorithm powering so much modern engineering analysis.

## The Moment It Clicked

I asked Claude to riff on "descent" somehow. The suggestions came back: Gradiant Descent (too wordy), Gradescent (loses clarity), various mashups. Nothing quite landed.

"What if we went back to 'derivative' instead of 'gradient'?" I asked.

Claude shifted phonetic territory entirely: Derivex, Derivux, Derivian.

**Derivux.** The moment I saw it, something clicked.

It wasn't objectively better than the alternatives. But it solved multiple problems simultaneously. Two syllables with hard consonants that end clean—it sounds like software, not a pharmaceutical. The "Deriv-" prefix signals calculus and rate-of-change to anyone doing simulation work. Unlike "gradient," which countless ML projects have claimed, "Derivux" was a clean slate. And the "-ux" suffix echoes Linux and Redux, suggesting a platform rather than a feature.

The name emerged not from a single brilliant suggestion but from dozens of iterations. Each round refined the direction until the right answer felt obvious in retrospect.

## What AI Brings to Creative Work

This wasn't Claude generating a perfect answer. It was genuine collaboration with an infinitely patient brainstorming partner.

**Tireless breadth.** Claude generated hundreds of options without fatigue or ego. A human collaborator might offer ten suggestions before getting invested in their favorites.

**Instant pivots.** When I added "more mathematical" as a constraint, Claude immediately produced categorized lists. Constraints became creative fuel rather than obstacles.

**Structure that frees intuition.** Tables organized by category let me scan quickly and trust my gut reactions instead of drowning in unstructured options.

Could I have done this alone in a notebook? Technically yes. But the compression of time matters. What might have taken weeks of background thinking happened in hours of active conversation.

## Making This Work for You

Start broad and constrain incrementally. Don't specify everything upfront—let the conversation clarify your thinking.

Use AI for exploration, not just execution. Naming, architecture decisions, UX flows—anything that benefits from rapid iteration with a collaborator who never tires and never gets defensive about rejected ideas.

Let the AI organize information. Your brain excels at pattern matching and gut-check evaluation. Let structure handle the rest.

Articulate why the winner won. When you land on the right answer, understand what made it right. This builds intuition and helps you defend choices to stakeholders.

## The Real Promise

"Derivux" didn't exist at the start of this process. It emerged from friction between what I wanted and what was offered—the same generative tension that has always driven human creativity, just compressed into something you can actually finish in an afternoon.

That's what AI collaboration offers at its best: not replacement of the creative process, but acceleration of it. The mess remains. The iteration remains. The moment of recognition when the right answer finally appears—that remains too. It just arrives sooner.
