I would like to have my default tmux window to be 2x2 open to the same direcotry location

## Assistant [2026-01-14T17:30:20.100Z]

I'll help you set up tmux to open with a 2x2 pane layout. Let me first check if you have an existing tmux configuration.

## User [2026-01-14T17:30:22.854Z]

## Assistant [2026-01-14T17:30:34.050Z]

You have an existing tmux config. There are two main approaches to get a 2x2 layout by default:

**Option 1: Add a hook to your tmux.conf** (automatic for every new session)

**Option 2: Create a shell alias/function** (run when you want the layout)

Which would you prefer? The hook makes every new tmux session start with 2x2 panes automatically, while the alias gives you more control over when to use it.

Here's what the hook approach would look like added to your config:

```bash
# Create 2x2 layout on new session
set-hook -g after-new-session 'split-window -h; split-window -v; select-pane -t 0; split-window -v; select-pane -t 0'
```

Want me to add this to your `~/.tmux.conf`?

# When Your Control Systems Final Becomes a Week-Long Documentation Sprint

There's something uniquely stressful about finals week, but there's also something oddly satisfying about turning chaos into order. Today's coding session wasn't about building new features or fixing production bugs—it was about survival. Specifically, surviving a Motion Control final exam with a 20-page cheat sheet and making sure a Minecraft server's Discord bot stops announcing villager deaths.

## The Cheat Sheet Challenge

The main task: create a comprehensive HTML cheat sheet for an ME 4231 Motion Control final exam. The constraints were specific—10 double-sided pages (20 PDF pages total), printable via Chrome Headless, covering everything from 11 lectures, multiple labs, and an entire semester of control systems theory.

This is where Claude Code shines in ways I didn't expect. The challenge wasn't just "summarize this content." It was:

1. Parse dozens of PDF files, some too large to read in one pass
2. Extract the technically dense content (transfer functions, Z-transforms, digital filter implementations)
3. Organize it into a printable format with the right information density
4. Include reference tables (hex/ASCII from -256 to 256)

The approach I landed on was chunking large PDFs with overlap:

```
If a PDF is 10 pages:
- Read pages 1-6
- Read pages 5-10
```

The overlap ensures continuity between chunks. Without it, you might miss context that spans page boundaries—particularly dangerous with control systems where equations frequently continue across pages.

The lecture content itself covered the full gamut of digital control:
- Sampling and reconstruction (ZOH, FOH)
- Z-transforms and discrete transfer functions
- Digital filter implementations (Direct Form I, II, Transposed)
- PID tuning in the discrete domain
- State-s
