# When Your Bug Could Break a Tool: Building a Safer CNC Postprocessor

Today's coding session went deeper into the physical constraints of CNC machining than any before. What started as routine G-code debugging became a dive into manufacturing safety, the physics of cutting metal tubes, and why the order you remove tabs from sheet metal actually matters.

## The Bug That Could Have Crashed a Tool

The day began with what seemed like a simple question: "Can you take a look at this G-code and see if something looks funny in the first few commands?"

Looking at the output from PenguinCAM—a CAM postprocessor I've been building for an FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition, a high school robotics program) team—I spotted something concerning. For context, a postprocessor translates toolpath geometry into the specific G-code dialect a particular CNC machine expects. Here's what the output looked like:

```gcode
G0 X1.1285 Y-0.1243
G0 Z1.2500
G0 Z0.7475
G1 F55.0
G3 X1.0885 Y-0.1243 I-0.0200 J0.0458
```

The problem? Line 3 is a `G0` (rapid movement) directly to the cutting depth. The tool would slam into the material at full speed instead of plunging at a controlled feed rate.

To understand why this matters, consider the speeds involved. A typical rapid traverse might move at 200-400 inches per minute, while a safe plunge rate for aluminum might be 20-30 IPM—an order of magnitude slower. That `G0` instead of `G1` means the endmill hits the material at ten times the intended speed. The cutting forces spike, the tool flexes, and you're looking at a snapped endmill, a gouged workpiece, or—if the part isn't clamped properly—aluminum flying across the shop.

This is exactly the kind of bug that's easy to miss when you're generating G-code programmatically.

I would like to have my default tmux window to be 2x2 open to the same direcotry location

## Assistant [2026-01-14T17:30:20.100Z]

I'll help you set up tmux to open with a 2x2 pane layout. Let me first check if you have an existing tmux configuration.

## User [2026-01-14T17:30:22.854Z]

[Tool Result:      1→set -g mode-keys vi
     2→set -g mouse on
     3→
     4→

]

## Assistant [2026-01-14T17:30:34.050Z]

You have an existing tmux config. There are two main approaches to get a 2x2 layout by default:

**Option 1: Add a hook to your tmux.conf** (automatic for every new session)

**Option 2: Create a shell alias/function** (run when you want the layout)

Which would you prefer? The hook makes every new tmux session start with 2x2 panes automatically, while the alias gives you more control over when to use it.

Here's what the hook approach would look like added to your config:

```bash
# Create 2x2 layout on new session
set-hook -g after-new-session 'split-window -h; split-window -v; select-pane -t 0; split-window -v; select-pane -t 0'
```

Want me to add this to your `~/.tmux.conf`?
